# **Jacob Carter Portfolio**

It took me many months to come up with a design that would suit my personality, while displaying my skills. They say your worst client is yourself, and that's certainly true.

In the end, however, I created a UI/UX design that I absolutely love. I try to show off my technical abilities throughout the website, while keeping it light.
