      Goal of project
    </h2>
    
    <p class="text-white">
      After a couple of weeks learning HTML and CSS, I regularly struggled to remember CSS flexbox, which would frustrate me endlessly when buildings layouts. I decided that the best way to effectively learn flexbox was to build a project focused entirely on the given subject.
      <br>
      <br>
      I wanted a website that would display the most common flexbox properties, as well as the most common values for such properties. A text animation would cycle through these values, displaying an appropriate graphic to go alongside it. My goal was to regularly use the website for reference when building future projects, which I (and others) eventually did.

      Challenges Faced
    </h2>
    
    <p class="text-white">
      More than any previous client project, I managed to design a wireframe and hi-fi Figma prototype that was almost identical to the final product. Being a relatively simple project, there werenâ€™t many technical hiccoughs. However, my problems came about when trying to deploy the website.
      <br>
      <br>
      Without the knowledge I have now of front-end website deployment services, such as Netlify and Vercel, my only obvious option at the time was to create a custom WordPress theme for CSS Display Info. Creating a WordPress theme took an unnecessary amount of time to learn and develop, though it gave me some beginner knowledge into PHP.
      <br>
      <br>
      This was also my first encounter with browser support issues. I learnt after publishing the website, through a comment on Reddit, that the websites UI had been terribly disfigured on Mozilla Firefox. I later found out that some of the methods of importing fonts, animations, and the blur property had differing levels of support to other browsers, such as Chrome and Opera. I later fixed these discrepancies when I moved from WordPress to Netlify.
